# Congenital-Syphilis
My research question for my final data analysis is "What is the association between incidence of congenital syphilis across Louisiana counties and County Health Outcome Rankings for 2015?" The data for this analysis is compiled from AtlasPlus (NCHHSTP) and countyhealthrankings.org. This project is completed through statistical significance analyses, including t-tests and a Spearman correlation test.
